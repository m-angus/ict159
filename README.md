ICT159 Major Assignment


This program was required to:

read a file with a list of customer names alongside numbers (corresponding to amount in cents); 
these values in structs; 
calculate which coins should be given to each customer (50c, 20c, etc); 
take a series of inputs from user, asking for a name from the list of names; 
output those names and their associated coins; 
write a list of the inputted names and coins to a .CSV file, with the coins of recurring names summed to one row under a single name.


I've included the text and .CSV files I used for this assignment in the repository.
